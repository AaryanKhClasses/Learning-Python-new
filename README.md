# Learning-Python-new
### Learning Python *again*
---
# This is me learning Python *again*!
### But this time, instead of learning from the [Python Website], I'm learning it from [Udemy]!
### This is a detailed description and example-based series from the course from which I am learning!
### If you want to learn this on [Udemy], you can just see this [course].
### If you have any doubts, just [submit an issue here] **or** enroll in this [course] and directly talk with the instructor!
